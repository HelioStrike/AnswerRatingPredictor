Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. It stands for Java Development Kit. It stands for Java Runtime Environment. It stands for Java Virtual Machine. It is the tool necessary to compile, document and package Java programs. JRE refers to a runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. It is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides run-time environment in which java bytecode can be executed. Along with JRE, it includes an interpreter or loader, a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development. In short, it contains JRE + development tools. It implements the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and provides all the class libraries and other support files that JVM uses at runtime. So JRE is a software package that contains what is required to run a Java program. Basically, it’s an implementation of the JVM which physically exists. JVM follows three notations: Specification(document that describes the implementation of the Java virtual machine), Implementation(program that meets the requirements of JVM specification) and Runtime Instance (instance of JVM is created whenever you write a java command on the command prompt and run class). I don't know.
